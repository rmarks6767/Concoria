# Concoria
The premise behind the game is to be able to do whatever you want in an open world environment.  There will be many different cultures and civilizations represented in the game as a whole.  Some of these civilizations will be inclined to fight one another based on their views while others will work together.  Several paths can be taken to reach an end goal state.  One is conquering the entire planet and working to unite them as a whole. The second is wipping out civilizations as a whole until only one civilization is left.  The last method is exploring the map to the point of finding all of the special objects and putting them back to their original places.
