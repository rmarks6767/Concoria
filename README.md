# Concoria
The premise behind the game is to be able to do whatever you want in an open world environment.  There will be many different cultures and civilizations represented in the game as a whole.  Some of these civilizations will be inclined to fight one another based on their views while others will work together.  Several paths can be taken to reach an end goal state.  One is conquering the entire planet and working to unite them as a whole. The second is wipping out civilizations as a whole until only one civilization is left.  The last method is exploring the map to the point of finding all of the special objects and putting them back to their original places. 

## Underlying Game Mechanics
The game utilizes many algorithms and code that was built to be dynamic, in order to work with eneimies, the player, and every object on screen.  In place there is a merge sort algorithm that helps determine what objects to reload onto the screen, in proper order, an algorithm for determining what text to print out onto the menus, and a game system for loading and keeping track of the quests the player has active.

## Running the Game
Currently there is only a build for Windows, but to run, download the current release and run the setup file.
